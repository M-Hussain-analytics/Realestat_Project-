# Real Estate Dashboard

### Project overview
This project presents an **interactive Real Estate Dashboard** that analyzes sales performance, revenue trends, property distribution, and agent productivity across multiple dimensions.

The dashboard helps stakeholders such as real estate managers, analysts, and decision-makers monitor financial performance, sales channels, and market distribution over time.
The dashboard focuses on 2024 data, with year-based filtering to compare historical performance (2022–2024).
### Key Objectives
- Track revenue, expenses, and income
- Analyze monthly sales trends
- Identify top-performing property types
- Evaluate the sales channels effectiveness
- Monitor agent performance
- Visualize geographical distribution of sales

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the exploratory phase, the following insights and patterns were examined:

1.Revenue & Financial Metrics

  - Total Revenue: 26M
  - Total Expenses: 9M
  - Total Income: 17M
  - Total Properties Sold: 44

### Analysis & Insights
- Revenue peaks align with specific months, highlighting seasonal buying behavior.
- Brokers still lead revenue generation, but online sales are rapidly catching up.
- Property demand favors condos and single-family houses, possibly driven by urbanization and family housing needs.

### Limitations
- The dataset represents a limited time window, focusing mainly on 2024.
- External factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, or inflation are not included.
- Customer demographics (age, income level) are unavailable, limiting behavioral insights.
- The dashboard reflects historical data only—no predictive modeling is included.
- Data source assumptions may affect accuracy if inputs are incomplete or outdated.
